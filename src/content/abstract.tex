Although restricted three-body codes are in some cases less physically revealing
than full $n$-body codes in simulating interactions and mergers of galaxy pairs,
they are much faster and more computationally efficient in sampling a large
solution space. For this reason, they are still widely used to reduce the
initial parameter space of merger simulations before proceeding to more
sophisticated, $n$-body models. In this work, we provide \texttt{jspamcli.py},
a user-friendly interface for interacting with an existing restricted
three-body code used in the Galaxy Zoo: Mergers project,
JSPAM \cite{Wallin2016}, and to be used in conjunction with an rendered
image creation and comparison suite which has been co-developed specifically
to integrate with \texttt{jspamcli.py}.
