French astronomer Charles Messier's
Catalogue des N{\'e}buleuses et des Amas d'{\'E}toiles (Catalog of Nebulae and
Star Clusters) contains 104 objects visible over the Parisian night sky that
were frequently encountered during his efforts as a comet hunter.
Although compiled in the
eighteenth century and officially published from his personal notes in
\citeyear{Messier},
the positions and characterizations of objects given by \citet{Messier} are
well-enough described that they are all easily and frequently
observed today by amateur astronomers across the planet. One such object carries the following
description (translated from the original French and sourced from
\texttt{http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/history/m-cat81.html}):
\begin{displayquote}
    It is double, each has a bright center, which are separated
    $4^{\prime}35^{\prime\prime}$.
    The two \say{atmospheres} touch each other, the one is even fainter than the
    other. \cite{Messier}
\end{displayquote}
Of course, in the late eighteenth century, Messier would not have been
predisposed to assuming that the \say{very faint nebula} with two touching
atmospheres that he describes would be the often-imaged
interacting galaxy pair, Messier 51a and b.
Four years after \citet{Messier}, German philosopher Immanuel Kant
theorizes that perhaps, the exceedingly dim yet huge \say{stars} are not
stars but seem to be most easily characterized as other Milky Ways \cite{kant}.
The main member of the pair is more colloquially referred to as the Whirlpool
Galaxy, which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:m51}.

Galaxies are much less frequently found in isolation than they are found
in systems of galaxies, which suggests that the frequency with which events
leading to their interactions occur is relatively high.
Further, \citet{Alladin1965} found that even in simulated collisions of
relatively simple extended galaxy models, close encounters of galaxies could
increase their internal energies (relating to the motions of stars)
on the same order of magnitude as their respective initial internal energies.
This implied that their first-order
approximation of the center-of-mass motions of each the galaxies as constant was
grossly inaccurate. Further results showed that as energy
is exchanged from the centers-of-mass to the internal energy of
the system, the structures of each galaxy could be dramatically disturbed, and in
some cases could fling stars and other material into intergalactic space.
The importance of collisions and mergers, therefore, is not
limited in scope to the structure of interacting galaxies, but can be extended
to the large-scale evolution of galaxies over the lifetime of the universe.

Nearly immediately one notices the visually striking and
scientifically puzzling structures of members of an interacting system as can
be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:main}.
These disturbed morphological features are commonly
referred to as \say{bridges and tails}~\cite{Toomre1972}.
Optical and spectroscopic observations can readily yield accurate measurements
of the final positions of galaxies in a merger, and occasionally the radial
velocities of the members of a system can be observed as well, but
the primary interest lies in the discovering the mechanisms that result in the
observed bridges and tails. This necessitates finding precisely the final
positions in space, the overall velocity field of system, and the angular
orientations of the system with respect to our position in space.
%
For this reason, work has been done
in the last 70 years to advance simulations of interacting systems, and further,
to optimize existing simulations for better convergence on solutions. In
essence, we are readily able to observe mergers how they appear now, but work must
be done to infer the conditions that resulted in the morphologies we see today.

%    more time to read into these topics.
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item Typically, starburst galaxies (galaxies that are in the midst of
%            heavy star formation) are observed in the midst of a merger. Much of the
%            work done in improving simulations of interacting galaxies is done in
%            support of research into other mechanisms in galactic evolution; the role
%            of mergers in changing the distribution of the star population is commonly
%            referenced as a potential source of star formation.
%        \item Hierarchical mergers in galactic evolution (as in the evolution of
%            galaxies from their initial generations to those we observe now.
%            \begin{itemize}
%                \item First generation $\to$ quasars $\to$ AGNs $\to$ modern galaxies
