    \caption[Project flowchart]{Flowchart describing how a run is processed and
        stored. It should be noted that tasks related to processing images with
        MergerEx must be done manually, but must only be done once. Further, the
        image creation suite that was developed alongside this project is not
        included here, as it is considered to be largely separate. It can be
        incorporated  immediately prior to \say{STOP}.
